# AI-Pacman-Projects 
This repo contains UC Berkeley's AI Pacman projects. 
These projects rely on various artificial intelligence algorithms and concepts which are then applied to Pacman including Q Learning, Markov Models, Graph Search, Adversarial Search, and Heuristics. 

For all of the projects, there is an autograder.py file that runs tests and evaluates the implementation of each algorithm/question.

Project 1: This project involves using graph search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*...) and cost/heuristic functions to navigate the Pacman maze. 
The implementation is found in the search.py and searchAgents.py files.

Project 2: This project involves using Adversarial search algorithms (Minimax, Expectimax) and Alpha-Beta Pruning to design various Pacman agents and seeing how they perform.
The implementation is found in the multiAgents.py, pacman.py, and game.py. 

Project 3: The project involves using Q-learning and value iteration algorithms to design agents that will be used in MDP Grids and Pacman. The implementation is found in valueIterationAgents.py, qlearningAgents.py, and analysis.py. 

Project 4: This project involves using the Hidden Markov Model given noisy observations about the agent's distance from ghosts in order to predict the ghost's location. The implementation is found in busterAgents.py and inference.py.
Only implemented Questions 1-8 for this project.
